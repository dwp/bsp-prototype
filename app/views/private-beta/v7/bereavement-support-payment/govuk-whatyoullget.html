         <h1 class="govuk-heading-l">What you'll get</h1>
         <p>The amount of Bereavement Support Payment you can get will depend on:</p>
         <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>your relationship to the person who died</li>
          <li>when you make your claim</li>
          <li>when you reach State Pension age</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Your payments will be paid into your <a href="/how-to-have-your-benefits-paid">bank, building society or credit union account</a>.</p>


         <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Your relationship to the person who died</h2>
         <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">If you were married or in a registered civil partnership</h3>

         <p class="govuk-body">You’ll get the higher rate if one of the following applied when your partner died:</p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
               <li>you were getting <a class="gov-link" href="">Child Benefit</a> for a child that lived with you</li>
               <li>you were told by the Child Benefit Office that you were entitled to Child Benefit for a child that lived with you</li>
               <li>you were pregnant</li>
             </ul>

             <p class="govuk-body">The most you can get is:</p>
             <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>a one-off payment of £3,500</li>
                <li>18 monthly payments of £350</li>
              </ul>

              <p class="govuk-body">If you’re not eligible for the higher rate, you’ll get the lower rate instead.</p>

              <p class="govuk-body">The most you can get is:</p>
             <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>a one-off payment of £2,500</li>
                <li>18 monthly payments of £100</li>
              </ul>

              <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">If you were living together as if you were married</h3>

              <p class="govuk-body">The most you can get is:</p>
              <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                 <li>a one-off payment of £3,500</li>
                 <li>18 monthly payments of £350</li>
               </ul>


            <div class="govuk-!-padding-bottom-3"></div>

            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">When you make your claim</h2>

            <p class="govuk-body">You must claim within 3 months of your partner’s death to get the one-off payment and all 18 monthly payments.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">If it’s been over 3 months but fewer than 12 months since your partner’s death, you can get the one-off payment but only some of the monthly payments.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">If it’s been over 12 months but fewer than 21 months since your partner’s death, you cannot get the one-off payment but you can still get some monthly payments.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">If it’s been over 21 months since your partner’s death, you usually cannot get any payments.</p>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">If you’re making a claim for backdated payments</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">The rules are different for claiming backdated payments.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">You can apply any time before 9 November 2024. However, you may get fewer monthly payments the later you claim.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">The most you can get is 9 monthly payments of £350.</p>

            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">When you reach State Pension age</h2>
            <p class="govuk-body">If you reach <a class="govuk-link" href="">State Pension age </a>within 18 months of your partner’s death, you may get fewer monthly payments.</p>


             <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If you get benefits</h2>
             <p class="govuk-body">Bereavement Support Payment will not affect your benefits for a year after your first payment. After a year, money you have left from your first payment could affect the amount you get if you renew or make a claim for another benefit.</p>
             <p class="govuk-body">You must tell your benefits office (for example, <a rel="external" href="https://find-your-nearest-jobcentre.dwp.gov.uk/search.php">your local Jobcentre Plus</a>) when you start getting Bereavement Support Payment.</p>
