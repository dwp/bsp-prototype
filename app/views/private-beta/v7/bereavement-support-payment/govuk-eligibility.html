         <p class="govuk-body">Bereavement Support Payment is not means-tested. This means what you earn or how much you have in savings will not affect what you get.</p>
         <p class="govuk-body">When your partner died, you must have been:</p>
         <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
           <li>under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/state-pension-age">State Pension age</a></li>
           <li>living in the UK or a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-benefits-abroad/bereavement-benefits">country that pays bereavement benefits</a></li>
           <li>married to your partner, in a civil partnership with them, or living with them as if you were married</li>
         </ul>
         <p class="govuk-body">Your partner must have either:</p>
         <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>paid a certain amount of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance/how-much-you-pay">Class 1 or Class 2 National Insurance contributions</a> in any one tax year since 6 April 1975</li>
            <li>died because of an accident at work or a disease caused by work</li>
         </ul>
         <div class="govuk-inset-text">
          You can still make a claim if you’re not sure whether your partner paid enough National Insurance contributions. The Bereavement Service will let you know.
        </div>
         <p class="govuk-body">You cannot claim Bereavement Support Payment if you’re in prison.</p>

            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">When you need to make your claim</h2>
            <p class="govuk-body">You usually need to make a claim within 21 months of your partner’s death.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">If it’s been over 21 months since your partner’s death, you may still be able to make a claim if their cause of death was only recently confirmed. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/bereavement-support-payment/how-to-claim">Call the Bereavement Service helpline</a> for help.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">How soon you make your claim can also affect <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/bereavement-support-payment/how-to-claim">how much money you’ll get</a>. You usually need to make a claim within 3 months of your partner’s death to get the full amount of payments.</p>
           
            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">If your partner died before 9 February 2023</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">You may be able to get backdated payments of Bereavement Support Payment if:</p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
               <li>your partner died after 5 April 2017 </li>
               <li>when your partner died, you were living together as if you were married</li>
               <li>you were under State Pension age on 30 August 2018</li>
             </ul>
             
             <p class="govuk-body">You must have also either been pregnant when your partner died, or had a child living with you when your partner died and either:</p>
             <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>you got <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit">Child Benefit</a> for that child between when your partner died and when you make your claim</li>
              <li>you’ve been told by the Child Benefit Office that you were entitled to Child Benefit for that child between when your partner died and when you make your claim</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="govuk-body">You must apply before 9 November 2024 to get any backdated payments.</p>

            <div class="govuk-inset-text">
              If your partner died before 6 April 2017, you may be able to get <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/widowed-parents-allowance">Widowed Parent’s Allowance</a> instead.
            </div>

            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If you were living with your partner as if you were married</h2>
            <p class="govuk-body">Unless you’re applying for a backdated payment, one of the following must have applied when your partner died:</p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>you were getting <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit">Child Benefit</a> for a child that lived with you</li>
              <li>you were told by the Child Benefit Office that you were entitled to Child Benefit for a child that lived with you, even if you chose not to get it</li>
              <li>you were pregnant</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="govuk-body">If your partner was getting or entitled to Child Benefit instead, you’ll need to make a new claim for Child Benefit in your name before you can apply for Bereavement Support Payment.</p><br>
